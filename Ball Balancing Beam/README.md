# Projects-in-Code
Some of my work has to deal with code and programming. This is where I would like to store them.

## Abstract
The project Ball balancing bot follows the goal of developing a model and controller for the bot in order to balance a ball in the centre of a grooved track. If we push the ball away from the centre the bot automatically brings back and balances the ball at its mean position. Recognizing all these challenges involved in the problem statement, we have come up with various strategies to :-
1. Design the mechanical model and identify the manufacturing techniques required.
2. Instrument the system with a required sensor to track the ball movement. We have used ultrasonic sensors for detecting the position of the ball 
3. Identify the actuator required to achieve the tasking taking torque, angular speed, etc. into account. We have used a servo motor for controlling the ball position.
4. Select the microcontroller in order to control the motor properties, we have spent time to learn controlling servo motors using Microcontroller.
5. Identify suitable signal conditioning for the sensor outputs. We have also gone through the basics of PID control algorithms in order to design the system required for achieving the problem statement.
