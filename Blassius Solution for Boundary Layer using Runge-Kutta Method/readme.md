# Blassius solution for laminar boundary layer

The objective is to obtain the Blasius solution for laminar boundary layer over
a flat plate in zero pressure gradient numerically using Runge-Kutta method
and Newton-Raphson methods.

The report is available as [a pdf file](/Code/AM5530_Programming_Assignment.pdf).
The code is available in the code folder. To run the simulation, run the [*Programming_Assignment*](Programming_Assignment.m) file.
The resultant figures and data are also available.
