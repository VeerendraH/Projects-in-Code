# Blassius solution for laminar boundary layer

The objective is to obtain the Blasius solution for laminar boundary layer over
a flat plate in zero pressure gradient numerically using Runge-Kutta method
and Newton-Raphson methods.

The report is available as a pdf file [a relative link](other_file.md).
The code is available in the code folder. To run the simulation, run the *Programming_Assignment.m* file.
